## Analysis of Loan Stats using Resampling and Ensemble Learning
### Trained and compared 2 different ensemble classifiers to predict loan risk. Used Balanced Random Forest and Easy Ensemble Classifiers to complete the analysis. Created imbalanced classification report, balanced accuracy score, confusion matrix for each sampling method. Also sorted features by order of importance for the Balanced Random Forest Classifier.
### 1. Which model had the best balanced accuracy score? 
### Easy Ensemble
### 2. Which model had the best recall score? 
### Easy Ensemble
### 3. Which model had the best geometric mean score? 
### Easy Ensemble
### 4. What are the top three features? 
### total_rec_prncp, last_pymnt_amnt, total_pymnt_inv
